## Findings Summary

## Contributions
Our team met several times during the week of the assignment to ensure the tasks were completed on time. Meeting before and after the instructor meeting to ensure that we had a good understanding of the assignment requirements. There was some initial confusion over the exact requirements of the assignment, but after clarification from the professor it was discussed and remedied. With the information from the professor about how to conduct the proper code review and work with CWEs, the group worked together to ensure that the assignment could be completed per the requirements. Once the requirements were realized the team evenly divided the workload and completed it to the satisfaction of the group. As mentioned in previous weeks we worked through our tasks in GitHub, and everyone completed their tasks. The group met again prior to turning in the assignment after all parts were compiled to ensure that nothing as missing. The team will continue to collaborate and get assignments completed together as we have in the past.
