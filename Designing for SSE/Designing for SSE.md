# Data Flow Diagrams  

## DFD Level 2 Report

# Introduction
Our data flow diagram combines each team members level 0 DFD's which we combined into a level 2 DFD. In this single diagram we show the user flow within the Nextcloud environment, with a user accessing a file within the system. We also show an external entity being the user, accessing the Nextcloud interface via Apache or utilizing the android mobile application. We go from the Apache interface that controls web encryption and communication into the Nextcloud server itself. From the Nextcloud server we access the database and the file storage location. All of this is dependent on the authentication sources that the database connects to and the multifactor authentication for those accounts.

# Observations  


# Reflection  
This week’s assignment regarding threat modeling went very well.  We were able meet three times this week, once with Dr. Gandhi. The first time we met was to talk out the assignment and understand what was needed for the discussion with Dr. Gandhi.  Our discussion with Dr. Gandhi lead to a quick post meeting huddle where we worked together to create a level 2 threat model together.  We met again Friday to finalize what each member would need to accomplish before the following Monday. Our team works very well together as always and we didn’t have any issues in completing the assignment as at this point, we have a workflow that works for all of us.
