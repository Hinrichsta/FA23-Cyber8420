Reflection – This week’s assignment regarding threat modeling went very well.  We were able meet three times this week, once with Dr. Gandhi. The first time we met was to talk out the assignment and understand what was needed for the discussion with Dr. Gandhi.  Our discussion with Dr. Gandhi lead to a quick post meeting huddle where we worked together to create a level 2 threat model together.  We met again Friday to finalize what each member would need to accomplish before the following Monday. Our team works very well together as always and we didn’t have any issues in completing the assignment as at this point, we have a workflow that works for all of us.
