Did not see the domain name in the registrars approval list.
Solution verify domain name is in the approval list to prevent cybersquatting, a term used by bad actors to contact customers to phish for their information.
Nextcloud uses http instead of https (s stands for security) 
Solution: redirect webservers from http to https based upon the industry best practice and standards. This technique prevents ip spoofing and also campaign phishing
In the Database Configuration documentation, it references MySQL, MariaDB and PstgreSQL, I did not I did not see Oracle 19c (which is recommended) to install
Solution: Oracle 12c end-of-life ended on 12/31/2022. Recommend upgraded from 12c to 19c. Other solutions such as MariaDb may not work in all environments
Installation Issues going from 25.0.11 to 26 were discussed in the nextcloud community. Users were not able to revert 26.0.2.1 back to 26.2.2 after upgrade installation.
The users were also missing data after the upgrade. Based upon the nextcloud community, there was not a fix available at that particular time.
Solution: Update release notes to inform customers of mitigations and fixes of bugs when they come available

Solution: I would also recommend other encryption methods in protecting consumerâ€™s data. One data encryption example is Tripe Data Encryption Standard (DES).
Triple DES is a symmetric encryption technique and more advanced of the Data Encryption Standard (DES).
Compliments to Nexcloud for being the first vendor to implement End t0 End Client-side Encryption.
This technique ensures neither nextcloud server nor any code provides (like in the browser) has ever access to the unencrypted data.
