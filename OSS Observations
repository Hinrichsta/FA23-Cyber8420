Did not see the domain name in the registrars approval list.
Solution verify domain name is in the approval list to prevent cybersquatting, a term used by bad actors to contact customers to phish for their information.
Nextcloud uses http instead of https (s stands for security) 
Solution: redirect webservers from http to https based upon the industry best practice and standards. This technique prevents ip spoofing and also campaign phishing
In the Database Configuration documentation, it references MySQL, MariaDB and PstgreSQL, I did not I did not see Oracle 19c (which is recommended) to install
Solution: Oracle 12c end-of-life ended on 12/31/2022. Recommend upgraded from 12c to 19c. Other solutions such as MariaDb may not work in all environments
Installation Issues going from 25.0.11 to 26 were discussed in the nextcloud community. Users were not able to revert 26.0.2.1 back to 26.2.2 after upgrade installation.
The users were also missing data after the upgrade. Based upon the nextcloud community, there was not a fix available at that particular time.

Solution: Update release notes to inform customers of mitigations and fixes of bugs when they come available

Solution: I would also recommend other encryption methods in protecting consumer’s data. One data encryption example is Tripe Data Encryption Standard (DES).
Triple DES is a symmetric encryption technique and more advanced of the Data Encryption Standard (DES).

I would also recommend both a public key and a private key. Symmetric keys is used to encrypt and decrypt data
Asymmetric keys uses two keys: The public key is to decrypt data. The private key is used to decrypt data. This method is widely used in when sending and receiving emails. 

Compliments to Nexcloud for being the first vendor to implement End t0 End Client-side Encryption.
This technique ensures neither nextcloud server nor any code provides (like in the browser) has ever access to the unencrypted data.

Remediation: Recommend upgrade Nextcloud Desktop Client to 3.6.3. There are no known workarounds for this issueSystem requirements
Webserver: 
•	Apache 2.4 with mod_php or php-fpm (recommended)
•	nginx with php-fpmWeb server configuration
•	The recommended nginx configuration changed.
PHP Runtime
•	7.4 is no longer supported
•	8.0 (deprecated)
•	8.1 (is not recommended)
•	8.2 (recommended)

CVE-2021-45105 is a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability that enables malicious actors to execute arbitrary Java code, taking control of a target server.
Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-alpha1 through 2.16.0 (excluding 2.12.3 and 2.3.1) did not protect from uncontrolled recursion from self-referential lookups. This allows an attacker with control over Thread Context Map data to cause a denial of service when a crafted string is interpreted. 
Remediation:
This issue was fixed in Log4j 2.17.0, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1.

Apache Log4j2 Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
CISA Recommendation:
For all affected software assets for which updates exist, the only acceptable remediation actions are: 1) Apply updates; OR 2) remove affected assets from agency networks. Temporary mitigations using one of the measures provided at https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ed-22-02-apache-log4j-recommended-mitiga
CISA description:
Apache Log4j2 contains a vulnerability where JNDI features do not protect against attacker-controlled JNDI-related endpoints, allowing for remote code execution. 
CVE-2021-44832
Apache Log4j2 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0 (excluding security releases 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1) JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker-controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. From version 2.16.0 (along with 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1), this functionality has been completely removed. Note that this vulnerability is specific to log4j-core and does not affect log4net, log4cxx, or other Apache Logging Services projects.
