## About GetFINHelp:  

GitFINHelp is a financial in business which has been in business for over twenty years. Its primary mission is to help and serve the community through challenging and difficult times.  
GitFINHelp  collaborated with other businesses and organizations in reaching out to our large and small business owners. GetFINHelp recently was awarded a government grant to help better serve our disabled veterans in financing a home as first-time home buyers  
By reaching out to our disabled veterans allowed GetFINHelp to implement an advanced state of the art technology in computer systems across the country.  
GetFINHelp advanced computer systems allow our mission partners to adhere to both state, federal and local policies.  
GetFINHelp strategic governance ensure the industries best practices in protecting our business environment. Those strict standards include regulatory compliance, security policies is what sets our industry apart.  

## Security Policies and Strategic Objectives:  

GetFINHelp uses the industry’s best practice for securing our network from vulnerabilities. Our business strategic plan uses the industries best practice in securing and maintaining our network from vulnerabilities and intrusions.  
For example, our software developers are certified and trained in software assurance. One of the key elements of software assurance understands the framework for software Development.  

## Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF):  

The Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) version 1.1 instituted by the National Institute of Standards (NIST) SP 800-218 is a process which can be implemented for mitigating the risk of software vulnerabilities.  
This framework captures the process of people, processes and technology in performing a robust and secure process in software development.  

## Risk Management Framework:  

The Risk Management Framework uses a seven-step approach in defending internal processes in protecting our network:  
0. PrepareCreate a risk management strategy and assess the organizational risk tolerance
1. Categorize SystemAccording to CNSSI 1253/Initiate the Security Plan
2. Select Security ControlSelect your security controls based upon your network
3. Implement Implement security architecture based upon security controls
4. AssessAssess Security Controls
5. AuthorizeSubmit Security Authorization Package (Security Plan, SAR and POA&M) to Authorizing Official who determines final risk assessment
6. Continuous MonitoringContinuous monitoring of the network  

## Cryptography National Institute of Standards (NIST):  

Cryptography is a technique used to mask data from being read or accessed through malicious actors. There are several solutions cryptography can be implemented to encrypt data. Refer to [Cryptography | NIST](https://www.nist.gov/cryptography) for further guidance.  

## Nextcloud Security Vulnerabilities Found:  

The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) indicated a severity base code of 5.3. This severity code indicated there is a vulnerability weakness enumeration in the system. The vulnerability indicated an improper restriction of excessive authentication attempts.  
The in resolving this issue, the following recommendations would be a viable solution:  
* Ensure the proper configurations settings of the system, such as the enterprise server are in place and configured properly.  
* Install the latest software patches to the latest version.  CVE-2023-39955 indicated the latest path is 4.8.0  
* Recommend the proper security controls and mechanisms are in place.  
Based upon previous months, Nextcloud Security Vulnerabilities (XSS) will need updating based upon the latest recommended patch. The latest patch release was on August 10, 2023. The last update was on August 16, 2023

## Security related issues:  

There was no security policy implemented or enforced for this open source software  
**The open source software does not align with industry best standards**  
**There are no network diagrams documented for review the topology of the network**  
**The latest version of load balancers and software were neither installed nor configured properly**  
**There are no access controls, security controls or mechanisms were in place to deny access to server files, applications, xml files, CSS, templates, test files, etc.**  
**Recommend implementing CNSS1253 policy for all access controls**  
**All data files must use encryption features when transporting files over an open or closed network.**  

## Reflections:  

Extremely difficult to find software which software developers continued to develop and maintain. I reviewed several files for this project and found I was going into the land of the abyss! From a cyber-security standpoint, I did not see any industry best practices when it came to securing software based on guidance such s NIST SP 800-53 rev 5. I recognized the software developers use this opens source code by making additional tweaks to install on their organizational network. I could not verify if the developers performed a benchmark test before implementation on the production environment. I would only hope before implementing any open source software, the software developers test the software on all three networks (development and test) before placing on a production environment.
